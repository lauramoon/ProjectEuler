# ProjectEuler
Commented scripts to solve poblems at projecteuler.net

Note that Project Euler only allows solutions to its problems to be published for educational purposes, and only for the first 100 problems. Please do not look at this code if you are trying to solve a problem yourself and are stuck. Note that actual answers are not in these scripts, only code that can generate answers.

If you wish to educate yourself on how I have solved these problems using python, please examine the code and comments carefully.

Note: Problems 5 and 15 only require a calculator, so no solutions are posted.
